**Delivery Shipment Web App Design**

## Overview

Zap-Shift is a modern web-based delivery and shipment management platform designed to help businesses, delivery agents, and customers manage shipments in a fast and simple way.

This Figma design focuses on clarity, speed, and usability so that orders, tracking, and delivery status can be managed without confusion.

The goal of this project is to create a clean, scalable UI that developers can easily convert into a real working web application.
